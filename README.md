## Goal of the site

I created this website to show off some of the projects that I have worked on.
The projects page has links to the websites of a couple projects that I have created.

The website is also used to sell clothes. I don't expect anyone to buy clothes directly on it, but I created this page for fun to figure out how to implement an online store. If you really wanted to you could buy directly from the site as paypal checkout is integrated and it is fully functional.
